### Hi there!

I'm Nilai, and I am a student studying physics. I am interested in data science and how data can be analyzed and modeled to answer our most pressing questions. I'm currently working on [pycellfit](https://github.com/NilaiVemula/pycellfit), a project at my research lab to analyze inter-cellular forces in a cell layer, and [neural-net-cell-segmenter](https://github.com/NilaiVemula/neural_net_cell_segmenter), a deep-learning semantic segmentation to extract geometric information from microscope images of cell layers. In my free time, I am learning about machine learning through side projects.

The best way to contact me is at nilai.r.vemula@vanderbilt.edu.
